`Qlib-Server` is the data server system for [`Qlib`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib). It enable `Qlib` to run in `online` mode. Under online mode, the data will be deployed as a shared data service. The data and their cache will be shared by all the clients. The data retrieval performance is expected to be improved due to a higher rate of cache hits. It will consume less disk space, too.

To sum up, `Qlib-Server` is designed to solve the following problems:

* Manage the data in a centralized way, which makes data management (including cache management, date updating) much easier.
* Reduce the amount of cache to be generated.
* Make the client light-weighted and leverage the powerful computing resources of remote server

# Framework of Qlib-Server

<div style="align: center">
<img src="docs/_static/img/framework.png" />
</div>

The `Client/Server` framework of `Qlib` is based on `WebSocket` considering its capability of **bidirectional communication** between client and server in **async** mode.

`Qlib-Server` is based on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), which is a micro-framework for Python and here [Flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io) is used for websocket connection. 

# Quick start


## Deployment

### One-click Deployment

One-click deployment of `Qlib-Server` is supported, you can choose either of the following two methods for one-click deployment:

- Deployment with `docker-compose`
- Deployment in `Azure`

#### One-click Deployment with `docker-compose`

Deploy `Qlib-Server` with `docker-compose` according to the following processes:

* Install `docker`, please refer to [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).
* Install `docker-compose`, please refer to [Docker-compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
* Run the following command to deploy `Qlib-Server`:

    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib-server
      cd qlib-server
      sudo docker-compose -f docker_support/docker-compose.yaml --env-file docker_support/docker-compose.env build
      sudo docker-compose -f docker_support/docker-compose.yaml --env-file docker_support/docker-compose.env up -d
      # Use the following command to track the log
      sudo docker-compose -f docker_support/docker-compose.yaml --env-file docker_support/docker-compose.env logs -f
    ```

#### One-click Deployment in `Azure`

Firstly, You need to have an `Azure` account to deploy `Qlib-Server` in `Azure`. Then you can deploy `Qlib-Server` in `Azure` according to the following processes:

* Install `azure-cli`, please refer to [install-azure-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

* Add the `Azure` account to the configuration file `azure_conf.yaml`

    ```yaml
        sub_id: Your Subscription ID
        username: azure user name
        password: azure password
        # The resource group where the VM is located
        resource_group: Resource group name
    ```
* Execute the deployment script by running the following command:

    ```bash

        git clone https://github.com/microsoft/qlib-server
        cd qlib-server/scripts
        python azure_manager.py create_qlib_cs_vm \
            --qlib_server_name test_server01 \
            --qlib_client_names test_client01 \
            --admin_username test_user \
            --ssh_key_value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
            --size standard_NV6_Promo\
            --conf_path azure_conf.yaml
    ```

To know more about one-click Deployment, please refer to [Qlib-Server One-click Deployment](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#one-click-deployment).

### Step-by-step Deployment

To know more about step-by-step Deployment, please refer to [Qlib-Server Step-by-step Deplyment]https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#step-by-step-deployment).


## Using `Qlib` in `Online` Mode

In the [Qlib Document](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest), the `Offline` mode has been introduced. 

With `Qlib-Server`, you can use `Qlib` in `Online` mode, please initialize `Qlib` with the following code:

```python
import qlib
ONLINE_CONFIG = {
    # data provider config
    "calendar_provider": {"class": "LocalCalendarProvider", "kwargs": {"remote": True}},
    "instrument_provider": "ClientInstrumentProvider",
    "feature_provider": {"class": "LocalFeatureProvider", "kwargs": {"remote": True}},
    "expression_provider": "LocalExpressionProvider",
    "dataset_provider": "ClientDatasetProvider",
    "provider": "ClientProvider",
    # config it in user's own code
    "provider_uri": "127.0.0.1:/",
    # cache
    # Using parameter 'remote' to announce the client is using server_cache, and the writing access will be disabled.
    "expression_cache": None,
    "dataset_cache": None,
    "calendar_cache": None,
    "mount_path": "/data/stock_data/qlib_data",
    "auto_mount": True,  # The nfs is already mounted on our server[auto_mount: False].
    "flask_server": "127.0.0.1",
    "flask_port": 9710,
    "region": "cn",
}

qlib.init(**client_config)
ins = D.list_instruments(D.instruments("all"), as_list=True)

```

For more details, please refer to [Qlib-Server Client](https://qlib-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html).

# More About Qlib-Server

The detailed documents are organized in docs. Sphinx and the readthedocs theme is required to build the documentation in html formats.

```bash
cd docs/
conda install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme -y
# Otherwise, you can install them with pip
# pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
make html
```
